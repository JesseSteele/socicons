Social icon Inkscape vector layers: to-spec, standard size & spacing, circle, disc, square, rounded, plain, black, white

## Disclaimer
These are icons I use, based on as much information as I can get from official guidelines from the social companies. Use at your own risk.

If you represent a brand that owns one of these icons and want to discuss a problem, let me know. I'm cool. I listen and want icons made according to specs. If your official GitHub profile submits a pull request containing a proper vector silhouette to replace the logo I already have included, I will update it immediately and without question or comment.

(Few things irritate me on a website as seeing an outdated icon or an icon not made to specs.)

## Requests and Contributions
1. Contribute, don't request.
2. Stay to form.
3. Read this.
4. Original work and to-spec officials only.
5. Seriously.

## Main and Lesser Social Sites
The "main" file contains icons most likely to be used on your client's website (or if you are a DIY-er developing your personal brand).

If we add too many icon layers to the same Inkscape file, it bogs the machine. More icons need the "lesser" popularity new file, not the main. Lessers are low priority by def.

(Yes, it contains the [Pacific Daily Times](http://pacificdailytimes.com) 'P' logo because, if your client writer does not want to contribute to the free and easy-reading PDT site then he should, wink.)

## Tool Icons
The "tools" file is for things like "Info" or "Consult" and other conceptual icons someone might want on a site. Low scope priority.

## O-Podcast Icon
This mic icon is "grouped", not "unioned" like other icons, so you can brand the giant, green dot. It's a separate file so updates and clones won't overwrite anything. Of course, the mic could represent anything, not just a podcast. Size, circles, and squares are all included to the same standard as others. This is what I used to make my own branded podcast logo icon at [jessesteele.com](http://jessesteele.com). My gift to you.

## Forking
Do it. Just know I maintain this.

## History
Everything I do is done to some kind of standard from the get go. I started this to get standardized, to-spec icons across my clients' sites and my own. I research the official specs for every icon I include and standardize the size to quickly implement along side other icons, whether plain, in circles, reversed discs, squares, etc. It eventually developed into a big, fat file, and I thought I might as well save the rest of you the time by sharing.

Credit where due, I first started this for a client wanting to use the Tesseract WP theme from [Tyler.com](http://tyler.com) tutorials. It's not a bad theme, but be advised that their awesome updates and improvements can really mess up your work if you don't keep a careful eye on the changes.

## Credit
...only according to the license, IF you are redistributing the original layered files in a package, which is cool. If you are using rendered raster/vector icons to be displayed in your work (like icons on a website, app, et cetera), no credit needed whatsoever.

Open Source for life. Game on.
