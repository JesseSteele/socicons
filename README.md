# Socicons for Inkscape
### To make your web-dev socification easier.
Social icon Inkscape vector layers: to-spec, standard size & spacing, circle, disc, square, rounded, plain, black, white

## Disclaimer
These are icons I use, based on as much information as I can get from official guidelines from the social companies. Use at your own risk.

# The main file with all the icons is here:

## About licsensing social media icons
I contacted Linkedin about using their icon and had friendly correspondence with them. I had the same experience with Twitter. Different brands have their own trademark standards. Using an outdated icon or messing with it too much could make problems for you, but a social media brand would be foolish to actually prosecute due to foreseeable public backlash. Twitter, for example, cares about the space between the bird and what it's next to. As I understand (not corresponded), the Facebook "f" isn't the actual "f", but the space around it. So, an "f" in a circle may actually be trademark abuse, but I have no official word from Facebook about this. I won't ask because they are too "big, corporate" and I wouldn't want to waste their time.

From my experience developing these, and seeing the different licensing used by social media brands, I created the "Ink Verb License", as a kind of GPL, to codify how people and brands generally and intuitively expect each other to use and understand social media icons. If you are a brand or want to license your own logo to be used as or in the style of social media icons, consider using this license to give developers:

[Ink Verb License 1.0](https://github.com/inkVerb/License)

#### Scope
The scope of these icons only allows icons whose trademark or intellectual property owners do not require Ⓡ or ™ notice in the icon in a "like-kind social media linked icon row".

#### Bookmarks
If you want generic icons or other work, I recommend these URLs. (Make a pull or issue if any expire plz)
https://material.io/icons/ (generic icons from Google, Apache 2.0 license)
http://www.socicon.com/chart.php (icons as font characters; use at your own risk, useful, but some seem imperfect or outdated)

#### Treatise on trademarks
Typically, as I understand, using a trademark is governed under "fair use" because the cultural context of a row of social media icons indicates either "sharing to one's own" or "linking to the public profile of" and is therefore "discussion with credit" of work(s) owned by others. This is similar to CNN playing a clip from Fox News with Fox News' own logos in it so they can comment on it. (In social media as well as news media, without the ability to talk about each other there probably wouldn't be anything to talk about.) So, as I understand, the question with protected intellectual property is profiteering via impersonating someone else or via defaming or confusing someone else's brand by misrepresenting a trademark when discussing it. As I understand, the key is to make sure a social icon is used like a social icon and that it is the actual social icon of the social media it represents. And, monochrome versions of colored logos are always allowed in a monochrome context because otherwise early black and white cameras would have to be outlawed.

This was why I created this project. Good as they are, I don't always trust other artists' work. Sometimes an artist's icon is disproportionate within the logo or within the spacing around the logo or the color is similar but not the correct color. As I understand, this is a small violation of terms for using logos. Moreover, as an artist myself, it sometimes misleads me or seems like it was made for refrigerator art by talented child who will out-do DaVinci, but hasn't yet. So, I check each brand for whatever I can find they say about themselves, do it myself, and share with you.

I put my own ™ on some of my own trademarks, but I never ask other people to do the same. This is because, in my opinion regarding my own efforts, putting the Ⓡ or ™ or ℠ or other trademark indicator is my own notice to the public that 1. I am doing business myself, using this trademark or servicemark and 2. that it belongs to me. That is my own effort as the owner of the trademark, etc. When other people give me credit or discuss it my trademarks, the trademark remains my own whether they say so or not; it is not other parties' responsibility to protect my own trademarks. So, I don't ask others to denote the trademark because I do not want to imply that someone not noting my trademark is any kind of waiver of my own rights, nor do I want to have to sue everyone who doesn't put Ⓡ on my work. So, I regard Ⓡ and ™ and ℠ as my responsibility, not yours. But, this my own practice, not necessarily the practice of others. That said, I understand it is common practice that social media icons linking or indicating (such as QR code or URL) an account with a social media brand uses the trademarked and governed logo, but that using the Ⓡ or ™ or ℠ is from oldschool practices and does not apply to digitally scallable social media.

#### Is This YOUR Icon?
If you represent a brand that owns one of these icons and want to discuss a problem, let me know. I'm cool. I listen and want icons made according to specs. If your official GitHub profile submits a pull request containing a proper vector silhouette to replace the logo I already have included, I will update it immediately and without question or comment. If you do not want your icon included in a to-standard distribution for icon "linked rows", let me know and I will delete your icon from every place I ever used it, including this project and all my blogs and websites.

## Requests and Contributions
1. Contribute, don't request.
2. Stay to form.
3. Read this.
4. Original work and to-spec officials only.
5. Seriously.

## Main and Lesser Social Sites
The "main" file contains icons most likely to be used on your client's website (or if you are a DIY-er developing your personal brand).

If we add too many icon layers to the same Inkscape file, it bogs the machine. Additional icons need the "lesser" popularity new file, not the main. Lessers are low priority by def.

(Yes, it contains the [Pacific Daily Times](http://pacificdailytimes.com) 'P' logo because, if your client writer does not want to contribute to the free and easy-reading PDT site then he should, wink. You might also use this as a comparison to other Newspaper websites, such as the New York Times 'T' if your client writes for the NYT.)

## Tool Icons
The "tools" file is for things like "Info" or "Consult" and other conceptual icons someone might want on a site. Low scope priority.

## O-Podcast Icon
This mic icon is "grouped", not "unioned", so you can brand the giant, green dot. It's a separate file so updates and clones won't overwrite anything. Of course, the mic could represent anything, not just a podcast. Size, circles, and squares are all included to the same standard as others. This is what I used to make my own branded podcast logo icon at [jessesteele.com](http://jessesteele.com). My gift to you.

## Forking
Do it. Just know I maintain this. I love pull requests if they are to form.

## History
Everything I do is done to some kind of standard from the get go. I started this to get standardized, to-spec icons across my clients' sites and my own. I research the official specs for every icon I include and standardize the size to quickly implement along side other icons, whether plain, in circles, reversed discs, squares, etc. It eventually developed into a big, fat file, and I thought I might as well save the rest of you the time by sharing.

Credit where due, I first started this for a client wanting to use the Tesseract WP theme from [Tyler.com](http://tyler.com) tutorials. It's not a bad theme, but be advised that their awesome updates and improvements can really mess up your work if you don't keep a careful eye on the changes.

## Credit for this project
...only according to the license, IF you are redistributing the original layered files in a package, which is cool. If you are using rendered raster/vector icons to be displayed in your work (like icons on a website, app, et cetera), no credit needed whatsoever.

Open Source for life. Game on.
